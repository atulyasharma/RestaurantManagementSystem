# RestaurantManagementSystem

Data Management and Database Design Project to improve Restaurant databases to improve efficiency in customer delivery, billing and inventory management

## Part 1 : Project Proposal

## Part 2 : Initial Entity - Relationship Diagram

Initial draft of ERD was made using Toad Data Modeler.

## Part 3 : Final Entity - Relationship Diagram

Based on further considerations and reviews, the final ERD is created after modifiying the initial ERD.

## Part 4 : Querying on MS SQL Server Management Studio

DDL commands are used to create Tables for each entitiy with Primary and Secondary keys for each entity.

DML commands are then used to fill the tables with values. Custom values were created for each table.

Stored Procedures, Triggers and Computed Columns were then created as per the requirements.

## Part 5 : Creating Dashboard using Power BI

To visualize the analysis of the entire restaurant management system, dashboard was created using Power BI for better understanding.
